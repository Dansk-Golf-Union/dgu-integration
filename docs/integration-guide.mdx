# Introduction

The Union Database holds information related to golf clubs and their members.

Continuously the Union Database also holds information about scores of members. Scoring app has access through the API via an API account.

## Document Audience

This document is for scoring apps who must post scores into the Union Database.

## Definitions

There are a few definitions worth knowing about.

**Club**  
A golf club has an official name, a short name, a number, and possibly an address.

**Course**  
A course is the actual course created by the club. A course has one or more tees with 9 or 18 holes.

**Member**  
A member is a person with one or more memberships. This means that the same person can have two or more memberships of different golf clubs.

**Scorecard**  
A scorecard holds information about the player, the course, the marker, and the actual score.

## Identifiers

All objects in the database have identifiers in the form of a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier).

The Scorecard object contains an External ID. This ID is supplied by the scoring app to reference a scorecard in the union database. This makes it simpler to modify a scorecard, because the scoring apps does not need to register the GUID locally.

## Data format

The data format used for exchanging data through the API is JSON.

## Authentication

Access to the API is done through **Basic Authentication**. Each vendor will be given an API account with a username and password. Each account is authorized to use a certain set of API resources.

## API Set

All requests to the API must include an **API Set** in the URL. The API Set is equal to the **username** of the account unless otherwise instructed.

## Base URL

The base urls for DGU is 
- dgubasen.api.union.golfbox.io
- test-dgubasen.api.union.golfbox.io

## Request headers

All requests to the API must include the following headers:

```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Basic <username:password>
Token: <OAuth token>
```

The `username:password` combination must be **Base64 encoded**.

## Token

The token for an API with player information is retrieved through the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. After the user logs in and grants consent, your application receives an authorization code. This code must then be exchanged for an access token via the token endpoint.

Once retrieved, the access token should be included as a variable in requests to protected API endpoints.

The token grants access based on the scopes requested during authorization (e.g. get_player.information). Be sure to store and transmit the token securely. If needed, refresh the token depending on the lifetime returned in the response.

For more details about OAuth authentication, refer to the [OAuth Guide](./oauth-guide).

## Error Handling

If a request fails, the API responds with standard HTTP error codes and messages.

Example:

```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
```

## Clubs

Clubs holds basic information of a given club. Focus point on Clubs is the ID which must be used to lookup courses (See section about Courses)

## Members

Every person in the database has an ID called LifeTimeID. The format of this number is [xxxxxx-xxx], where
the first 6 are based on the persons birthdate, and the last 3 are an increment integer grouped by
birthdate.

A person can be a member of a golf club. The relationship between a person and club is a membership. A
person can also be a member of more than one club, thus having multiple memberships.
Being a member in a golf club means that you get a member number, which is unique within the club. This
member number has nothing to do with the lifetime ID. If we put together the official club number and the
member number, we have a nationally unique reference for a member. This combination is called the
‘union ID’

Member info can be looked up by a lifetime ID or by union ID.
Member info consist of both personal info and membership info.
When a member is looked up the complete information including the person and all memberships is returned.

Here is a list of the member info.

### How do I look up member info?

This is dependent on your access level and agreement. 
1. If you represent a given golf club and have been given access to all members without their consent by the club then you can look up members in that (or those) club(s). 
2. If you are an independent actor you will need player consent to access their information. That is given through the OAuth login and accompanying token - refer to the [OAuth Guide](./oauth-guide). 

### Re point 1:

You can get info about a specific member in a club you are certified to access by making the following API request.
You can refer to the member by
• lifetimeID
• unionID

**Example Request**

```
GET https://<base_url>/<apiset>/Clubs/Golfer?lifetimeID=300191-001?unionID=202-331
```

**Example Response:**

```json

## Scores

All the scores that are posted to the database goes into a module called the “Scorecard Exchange”.
Scorecards will then later be picked up and processed, which ultimately would trigger a handicap
adjustment.

Here is a list of the scorecard info.
